**Overview**

In this project, I developed an inventory management system to further my understanding of relational databases and SQL queries. The software interacts with a SQLite database to store, retrieve, update, and delete product information. Users can manage products by adding details like name, category, price, and supplier. The purpose of this software is to practice basic database operations, improve my coding skills, and understand how to manage data using a relational database.

**Relational Database**

The relational database used in this project is SQLite, a lightweight SQL database engine that stores data in a file. The database includes a table named `products`, with fields for product ID, name, category, quantity, price, and supplier. This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of product details.

**Development Environment**

I used Python and the `sqlite3` library to develop this software. The Python programming language provides an easy-to-use environment for writing the code, while `sqlite3` handles the database interactions. The development was done in Visual Studio Code, which provided a simple and effective platform for coding and debugging.

**Future Work**

- Implement additional features like product category filters and reporting.
- Add error handling for database connection issues.
- Improve the user interface for better usability.
